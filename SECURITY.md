## 🛡️ Security Features

### Input Protection

The Rubik's Cube game implements strong security measures to keep your computer safe:

- **Safe Input Handling**: All keyboard and mouse inputs are carefully checked
- **Memory Protection**: The game can't access files it shouldn't
- **No Network Access**: The game doesn't connect to the internet
- **User Permissions Only**: Runs with normal user rights (no admin needed)

### What Makes It Safe

- **No File Creation**: The game doesn't create or modify files on your computer
- **Isolated Execution**: Runs in its own space without affecting other programs
- **Error Protection**: If something goes wrong, the game safely stops instead of crashing your system
- **Resource Cleanup**: Properly releases memory and graphics resources when closing
